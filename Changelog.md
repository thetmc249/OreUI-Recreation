# Changelog for Release v1.1 **1.20.1 Backport**

Created a backport for Minecraft 1.20.1 for those who may want to use it on the current popular version for Modded Minecraft!
### Due to being a backport, there are some minor GUI limitations such as:

- No custom selection slots
- No custom tooltips
- No custom scrollbars in menus
- No custom textboxes
