## What's New
- Support for 1.21.5 
- Advancements UI is now complete
- Updated Gamemode Switcher selector slots

## Legacy4J Notes
 Unfortunately seems like the Legacy4J mod uses the same container sprite for all of the UIs, so I can't give each container their own look so they won't have their unique color coded containers :(
## Fixed
- Colored Shulker boxes now have an OptiGUI format as well as an Optifine format #6
# Changelog for Release v1.1

Small release this time all is left is the Advancements after this. Please post an Issue on GitHub if I've missed something else!
