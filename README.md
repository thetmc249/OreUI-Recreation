**[OptiGUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/optigui) is optional but highly recommended for certain blocks to have their own GUIs! (Optifine is supported mostly with the exception of Barrels)**

## 1.21.4+ Only for now

Ore UI Recreation is a resource pack that tries to replicate the new Bedrock UI in Java with the  Chest, Ender Chest, and Shulker Box color coded UIs as well as matching the rest of the GUIs in the game with this 'rounded' style. (minus the controversal Horizontal Layout and HUD).

Feedback & Suggestions are greatly appreciated via the Issues!

### Pack Limitations

- Due to Resource Pack limitations, some UIs have irregular padding or may overlap each other.
- Optifine doesn't support custom Barrel GUIs
