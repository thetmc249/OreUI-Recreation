**[OptiGUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/optigui) is optional but highly recommended for certain blocks to have their own GUIs! (Optifine is supported mostly with the exception of Barrels)**

## Now Supports 1.21.4+ and 1.20.1!

Ore UI Recreation is a resource pack that tries to replicate the new Bedrock UI in Java with the  Chest, Ender Chest, and Shulker Box color coded UIs as well as matching the rest of the GUIs in the game with this 'rounded' style. (minus the controversal Horizontal Layout).

Feedback & Suggestions are greatly appreciated via the Issues!

### Pack Limitations

- Due to Resource Pack limitations, some UIs have irregular padding or may overlap each other.
- Optifine doesn't support custom Barrel GUIs

### Credits

- BoardSodie for the Hotbar design
- Pigzone00 for the inital Hotbar issue

### What's Left and any Future Plans?

With pretty much all of the in-game UIs finished, I'm planning to add support for other mods. Feel free to create an issue on GitHub on what mods you would want to be supported in the future!
